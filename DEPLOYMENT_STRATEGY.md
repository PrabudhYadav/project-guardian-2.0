Deployment Strategy for PII Detector and Redactor
Proposed Solution
Deploy the PII solution as a Sidecar Container in a Kubernetes cluster, attached to application pods that handle external API integrations, logging, and data ingress points. This acts as a proxy/interceptor for data streams passing through network layers or logs.
Alternatively, if the environment uses an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway, or NGINX), integrate it as a custom plugin (e.g., via Lua or Python extensions) at the gateway level to sanitize incoming/outgoing requests in real-time.
Justification for Placement

Network/Application Layer Focus: Based on the storyline's vulnerability (PII leaks in API logs and unmonitored endpoints), placing it as a sidecar or gateway plugin ensures data is redacted before storage or rendering in internal tools. This plugs gaps at the ingress/egress points without modifying core application code.
Scalability: In Kubernetes, sidecars scale automatically with pod replicas, handling millions of records via horizontal scaling. API Gateway plugins distribute load across instances, supporting high-traffic e-commerce like Flixkart.
Latency: The rule-based code is lightweight (processes ~1ms per record on standard hardware), introducing minimal overhead. For streams, it can handle batching; sidecar uses efficient proxies like Envoy for zero-copy interception.
Cost-Effectiveness: Low resource usage (small container image <50MB, ~100MB memory per instance). Leverages existing infra (Kubernetes/API Gateway), avoiding new services. Open-source tools reduce licensing costs; auto-scaling minimizes idle resources.
Ease of Integration: Sidecar requires adding a container spec to deployments (e.g., via Helm charts) and configuring traffic routing (e.g., intercept logs via shared volume or network proxy). Gateway plugins plug in via config files. Supports gradual rollout, A/B testing, and rollback. No downtime for existing apps.

Additional Considerations

Monitoring & Alerts: Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics on PII detections, latency, and error rates. Alert on high PII volumes indicating potential leaks.
Security & Compliance: Ensure redaction complies with DPDP Act/GDPR. Use secrets management for any configs; audit logs for redaction events.
Testing & Maintenance: Include unit tests for detection accuracy; load tests for scale. Update regex/patterns via config maps for evolving PII definitions.
Alternatives: If browser-side risks (e.g., internal web apps), consider a browser extension, but sidecar/gateway is more effective for server-side leaks.
Novelty: Hybrid with ML (e.g., NER via spaCy in container) for unstructured data in future iterations, but rule-based keeps it simple and fast.
